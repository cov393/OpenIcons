# Icon Collection Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **Icon Collection Repository**, a curated collection of custom-designed icons created for web projects, applications, and other digital interfaces. This repository serves as a centralized storage for icons I’ve crafted over time, made publicly available under an open license to enable reuse by developers, designers, and creators.

The goal of this repository is to provide a reliable source of high-quality, original icons that can be easily integrated into various projects. Each icon is designed with attention to detail, ensuring compatibility with modern design standards.

## Features
- **Diverse Icon Set**: Includes icons for UI elements, navigation, actions, and thematic graphics tailored for web and app development.
- **Formats**: Icons are available in SVG and PNG formats for flexibility across different platforms and use cases.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the [MIT License](#license) to allow free use, modification, and distribution.
- **Organized Structure**: Icons are categorized by type and purpose for easy navigation.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
/icons
  /ui           # Icons for user interface elements (e.g., buttons, toggles)
  /navigation   # Icons for navigation (e.g., arrows, menus)
  /actions      # Icons for actions (e.g., save, delete, edit)
  /thematic     # Thematic or project-specific icons
/docs           # Additional documentation and guides
```

Each icon is named descriptively (e.g., `ui_button_play.svg`) to indicate its purpose and category.

## How to Use
1. **Browse Icons**: Navigate to the relevant category folder (`/icons/ui`, `/icons/navigation`, etc.) to find the desired icon.
2. **Download**: Download the icon in your preferred format (SVG or PNG).
3. **Integrate**: Use the icon in your project:
   - **SVG**: Embed directly in HTML or import into design tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
   - **PNG**: Use in web or app interfaces, ensuring appropriate resolution.
4. **Reference**: Optionally, link back to this repository in your project credits to support its visibility.
